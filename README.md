# Advent of Code

![](elf.gif)

All of my Python code snippets for Advent of Code. 🐍❄️

For the curious, rather than those who want to learn good coding practices... (Although I tend to do some refactoring/cleanup before adding them to GitHub.)

Started in 2022, but I'll backfill previous years when I need a festive boost.

### Where's the `prod` data?

As per [AoC's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18ehed6/re_not_sharing_inputs_psa_deleting_and_committing/), I've nuked the `prod.txt` files from the repository; if you want to follow along with the production version, you'll need to download your own puzzle input from your own AoC account (and, of course, your "expected" Production answers will be different to mine!)
